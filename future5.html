      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-1" data-hold="f5-1">After a few years, climbing becomes more than just a few-times-a-week activity, it becomes a daily routine.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-2" data-hold="f5-2">I see myself going to the gym every day and taking training seriously.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-3" data-hold="f5-3">I go to my first outdoor climbing session with my friends, bringing crashpads and other equipment I've never used before.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-4" data-hold="f5-4">I soon try top roping for the first time. Although I'm nervous about the height, I slowly become more confident.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-5" data-hold="f5-5">Some of my friends start inviting me to small local competitions, and I figure I might as well try. At first, I'm nervous and fall more than I finish, but I try to keep my mindset the same as a normal session.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-6" data-hold="f5-6">I start sending harder problems, and some of the holds that used to feel impossible now feel easy, showing my progress in outdoor climbing.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-7" data-hold="f5-7">I begin competing in local comps more often, sending some routes with ease, but qualifying for the finals still feels out of reach.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-8" data-hold="f5-8">After a few seasons of training and climbing outdoors, I finally get my first time slot in qualifiers for the finals.</div>
      <div class="hold-popup popup-f5-9" data-hold="f5-9">I didn't win, nor I didn't even place in the top three, but I see how far I've come. The climbs that once felt impossible now feel natural to me. I remember why I started climbing in the first place: because it's fun, challenging, and full of problem-solving, just like when I first began years ago.</div>
