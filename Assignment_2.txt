Submit to Canvas the following:

A visualized diagram in PDF, or HTML, or a website link, using HypertextLinks to an external site., inspired by your own personal identity. Use text, images, videos, and/or sounds to imagine alternative futures for yourself and express them in a creative way using clickable links (i.e. hypertext). You can look at the above example by Mendi + Keith Obadike for inspiration, but your project does not need to follow the same format. Feel free to incorporate any material digital or analog (found text, images, or sounds from the web, photographs, sketches, collages etc.) to create the visual imagery of your diagram as long as you embed them into your project and make them clickable. Think creatively!

Tips for making a Hypertext diagram:

Select which platform you would use to make your Hypertext. A great way to get started is using PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote, Word, etc. This will allow you to hyperlink text, images, or one slide to another easily. There are also more advanced tools, like TwineLinks to an external site., or using HTML for your Hypertext, but you don’t have to use those unless you want to.

For inspiration, take a look at the example above by Mendi + Keith Obadike, Keeping Up Appearances (2001)Links to an external site., as well as the Rhizome Hypertext collectionLinks to an external site., or if you want to explore even more, the Rhizome ArtBaseLinks to an external site., which includes a number of screen-based works from 1999 until today. You can also find inspiration from the Lesson 7 modules on Net-Based Artistic Practices.
